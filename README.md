# 2048 Game in Python
Pranav Kanth Anbarasan  
CS5001, Spring 2023  
Project (2048)  

### Instructions on how to run the program:
1. Unzip the contents of the submitted file.
2. The file consists of 7 python programs (main.py, game_status.py, matrix.py, merge_matrix.py, turtle_controls.py, turtle_screen.py, test.py) and one read_me text file.
3. In order to open the game, run the main.py file in IDLE.
4. Enter the number of rows or columns you want in your 2048 board, in the IDLE window. It should be between 4 to 6, else will throw a ValueError.
5. The turtle window will open up allowing you to play the game with the help of the arrow keys in your keyboard.
6. If you wish to restart the game press 'r' in your keyboard.
7. If you wish to quit the game press 'q' in your keyboard.

### Features of the program:
1. Asking the user to enter the size of the board between 4 and 6 and creating a game of that dimension. 
2. The game will be able to shift elements inside the table in all the four directions (left, right, up, down).
3. The player will use the arrow keys to play the game.
4. The game will keep track of the score and display it on the board at all times.
5. If the player wants to end the game, he can just press the letter 'q' to quit the game.
6. If the player wants to restart the game, the player can just press the letter 'r'.
7. The direction to play, quit and restart the game is always visible on the turtle window.
8. If the user presses any keys other than what the game uses, the game will not be affected.
9. The program will not crash when the user enters an invalid value for the size of the board, instead the program will raise a ValueError.
10. The cells will be highlighted in different colour, when they merge.
